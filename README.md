## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

According to the summary output of our multiple linear regression model, vehicle length and ground clearance (and intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance. They have a significant impact on the miles per gallon (mpg) values in the dataset.

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because there is a significant linear relationship. Additionally, the p-value of our linear regression analysis is smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. This indicates that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and confirm that the slope is not zero.

The linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively as evidenced by a r-squared value of 0.71, indicating a strong correlation of the dataset.
